== Update SBT version in README.md

== Update references/pointers to reference.conf -> application.conf in README.md

== Tweak code to take advantage of Java 7's try(...){ } auto-closable's

== Identify and remove unused parameters in ObjectApi controller methods

== @Path("key") final String key and URLEncodingUtils.urlDecode(key) are used a lot.. might make sense to define a custom argument type mapper for these that automatically looks for the "path" in the pathVars and decodes it for the method

== Let's add some comments into application.conf to clarify what each config option is all about

== web.xml could use a little love. The servlet-name feels off.
   -- Remove <load-on-startup>
