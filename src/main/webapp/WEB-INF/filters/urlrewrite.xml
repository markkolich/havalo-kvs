	<!--
		NOTE: The "decode-using=null" attribute in the <urlrewrite> tag above
		is important.  This is set to prevent the Urlrewrite engine
		from URL decoding the request "path" before handing it off to
		Spring.  If this is NOT set, then Urlrewrite will URL decode
		a path of "/foo/bar%2Fcat%2Fdog" to "/foo/bar/cat/dog" which
		is wrong in the context of Havalo's RESTful API.
